# Introduction
This is a codebase to experiment upon the geometry of (Learned) ISTA, which is the companion to the ICASSP submission under the title: "On the Geometry of (Learned) ISTA".

## Requirements
The requirements for now are quite bloated, as they contain many packages that are not necesarrily needed to run everyhting. But at least it covers everyhting. The requirements are listed in the file "requirements.txt". To create a conda environment that fullfills these requirements one may run:
```
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```
Then activate the environment as:
```
conda activate <env_name>
```
